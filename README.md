# ADT7410-Interrupt
An example on how to do interrupts on the ADT7410 temperature sensor using Adafruit's library for Arduino.

I couldn't find any other examples of how to do this, so here's mine. This is a modified version of the included example. It could probably be done cleaner but hey, this works and hopefully saves someone else a day of spelunking the datasheet.
